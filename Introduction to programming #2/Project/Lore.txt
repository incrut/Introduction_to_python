No one knows what the reason for them to appear was. Ten years ago, all the forests became full of strange and hostile creatures. They murdered hunters, traders and any other people walking into the woods. It was the moment when many young, strong adventurers started their careers as monster slayers. 

As a child, you have always loved stories of brave adventurers who sacrificed their lives, saving people and protecting the weak. And once, when you were hanging out in a local tavern, you saw an old man. He had a long beard, so many scars, and he had a perfect shaped body. You did not pay any attention to this man until he started his speech. "Young people are so weak and coward nowadays so that they can't even protect what they love. If something is threatening their life, they would rather run away and sacrifice other's people life. I am so disappointed in this generation.". 

You were so shocked to hear about that from a simple old man and started arguing that an old man can't just accuse young of acting this way as not everyone wants to be the one who saves others. Also, you told him that he is just a graybeard old man who will do anything to save himself. An old man just grinned. He turned the other way, took a sip from his glass and said: "That's what I've been talking about. You are just another young egoist who does not care about the safety of the weak." 

You were furious to hear that from this self-confident old man, and then you told him: "I will prove you a silly old man that my generation and I can be brave adventurers! You will see!"

This situation pushed you to become one of your childhood heroes, to become an adventurer.

Now your adventure begins.
