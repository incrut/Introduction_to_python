This is the most valuable manuscript for all adventurers. It contains information of all known for the humanity monsters, their strong and weak sides.

Pig Bull - This creature looks like a pig the size of a big bull. It has two horns on its head, a snout instead of a nose, doglegs, and it does not have any tail. This creature is swift, and only a few people can manage to run away from them. However, they are not that strong, so almost any beginner adventurer can defeat them.

Lizard archer - This creature looks like an upright reptile with a bow the size of a human. It has green skin, a long tail and a lizard face. This is a serious enemy for beginner adventurers, but it is still possible to defeat it with a good strategy. This creature has a bow, and it shoots from a pretty far distance. That is why the damage it deals with is severe. However, the serious damage is compensated with weak damage sustainability. If you can survive their attack, you can trounce them.

Hedgefrog - This creature looks like a frog the size of a human. What is unusual is that its frog appearance still has hedgehog needles on its back, so it's almost impossible to hit him in his back. In addition to his strong back defence, it has a huge shield in its hand. This makes this creature very almost invincible. However, though it has high protection, it is very clumsy, and almost everyone can run away from it. Also, this creature is feeble, so it does not deal a great amount of damage. Hedgefrog is an opponent for experienced adventurers.
