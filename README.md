# Introduction_to_python

* Quick summary

This is the repository with my class and home work aimed at learning python. At the end of the course there will be a project for testing python skills.


### The theme of the project ###

I have decided to create a text RPG game as my project.


### Reason why I have decided to create such program ###

Since my childhood, I always loved computer games and especially RPG ones.
I've spent so much time playing such games as World of Warcraft, The Elder Scrolls and the Witcher 
(Which are in fact are my favourite computer games) and that is the reason why I really wanted to create something similar to one of my favourite computer games (or at least related to the same theme).


### What the program is going to do ###

So basically the program will be a mini-game that will tell a user a little story and ask questions about what one wants to do in this situation to change the story.


### What can be given as an input ### 

The user will have to write the answer to the computer's questions which will affect the program and change the story in another way.
A program will ask a user what action one wants to do and throughout a program, the user will answer the questions which will simulate the real game.
(Example of the commands: answer = input ('You saw a hole in a mountain, would you like to explore it? ') # if answer.lower() == 'yes': .....


### Desired output ###
The desired output is whole storytelling without breaks and crashes of the program. The result of the program will be a completed game.

### Where will the functions be used ###

The functions will be used at the beginning in order to introduce the main character and some probable situations in game which sometimes can be repeated.


### Loops ###
Loops will be used to run the program all the time until the user enters exit(quit) or completes the game.


### if-else ###
As I already have shown in the example my program will be mostly working with the help of if and else.


### try/except ###

If the user enters the wrong information the program will kindly ask him to correct his command and due to the help of try/except this can be easily done.
